          <p>
            In my free time, I busy myself with hands on activities such as
            tinkering with my motorcycles and cars. I thoroughly enjoy racing
            motorcycles and enhancing their capabilities be it through aero
            dynamic modifications or weight reduction. My position as Captain
            during weekend football sessions has been instrumental in honing my
            decision-making skills under pressure. Through delegating player
            positions and motivating the team, I have become adept at
            transformational leadership. Being a competitive individual,
            football allows me to compete with my friends as well as making it a
            very sociable activity.

            Refactoring existing code (improving it without changing what it
            does) to meet a certain set of standards or to implement a new
            technology is a common task for front-end and junior developers. For
            this particular Challenge, a marketing agency has hired you to
            refactor an existing site to make it more accessible.
